                    <h2>High Concept</h2>

                    <h2>Genre</h2>
                    <p>Incremental/idle game that begins with the player clicking the waffle, then buying upgrades to increase waffle production.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Platform</h2>
                    <p>The game will be accessible through all platforms that can access the internet. Gameplay involves simple button clicking and interactions, so the page can easily be designed to suit almost all screen sizes.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Story</h2>
                    <p>You start your adventure as a humble Belgian waffle baker, with a dream to become the world’s greatest waffle chef. You expand your operation by hiring employees and purchasing equipment, and eventually, take over the entire waffle industry. The themes throughout the early game will be lighthearted and positive, but as the game progresses themes will get darker as the greed and drive to make more waffles consumes you.</p>

                    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
                    <p>Graphics will have a cartoony and stylized appearance, with the colors being light and calm early game, and changing as waffle production increases. Visual elements will become more disturbing as the player progresses, and by the end will be much different than the aesthetic at the start. Sound will be minimal, and won’t include a traditional score, but sound effects will be used sparingly. Clicking the waffle and menu buttons, as well as notification popups and other significant events, will all have appropriate sound effects. Then, after the tone shift, ambient sounds will occasionally play to make the player unsettled.</p>

                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                        <p>The first few minutes will have the player clicking the waffle. Even then, behavioral momentum will compel players to keep clicking until they can progress, which won’t be long. Once the player starts upgrading their waffle production through various means, other mechanics begin to influence gameplay. Achievement becomes an integral aspect of almost all parts of progression, through achievements earned, upgrades bought, and advancements in the story. Eventually, blissful productivity will take effect once the player becomes invested enough in their playthrough, with players finding reward in expanding their waffle empire and increasing their power. Buying upgrades also allows players a choice of playstyle, active or passive, either clicking often or playing more idly.</p>

                        <h3>Control</h3>
                        <p>Since gameplay consists only of clicking things on screen, controls can work on almost all devices. For desktops and computers, the mouse would be, and for mobile devices or tablets, touch could be used in place of a mouse.</p>

                        <h3>New User Experience</h3>
                        <p>The simplicity of the game mechanics makes it easy for new players to pick up all the elements of play, but instructions will still be given. The same area of the screen used to display story and progress notifications will also tell players how to progress. Even in the event of a player accidentally skipping or missing the tutorial popups, the display and controls, as well as the text labeling them, make it straightforward how play.</p>

                        <h3>Player Learning</h3>
                        <p>What the player needs to learn when starting, is all one has to understand to beat the game. A player who clicks the waffle for the first time has all the skills he needs to experience the whole game. As for strategies and mechanics go, there is not much depth, and players will upgrade, wait, then upgrade more, until the next “goal” is reached. This is all an essential aspect of the game that is learned very early on.</p>
