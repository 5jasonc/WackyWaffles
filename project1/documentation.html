                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>I started writing my content right away since I had the initial concept in the back of my head for a while. After finishing the full game proposal, I started designed my webpages. I sketched a few variations of the home page (index.html) as the design there is much more complex than the other pages. After finding a good version to use for the splash screen I sketched simple layouts for the proposal, documentation, and project pages. Once I had my content and designs all prepped, I got to actually building the pages.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges Along the Way</h2>
                    <p>The splash screen (index.html) definitely took me the longest the complete. I was very over-zealous in my sketches, and had to simplify my concept a few different times as I went along to get things looking good because I was already spending too much time just on this one page (hours and hours) and the CSS was getting unwieldy. I also spent a good amount of time refining the look of the pages (especially index.html), to get things lined up pixel perfect, get the page very responsive and clean as it collapses, and many other things. Besides the splash screen, there wasnâ€™t anything else I struggled with for too long along the way.</p>

                    <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
                    <p>In my opinion, there are a few different areas I went above and beyond the project writeup. Most notably, my splash screen (as mentioned). I used flex box and floats to get everything looking nice, and I tried to make the page as responsive as possible. There are many changes as the page collapses, and the overall look, design, and feel of the page is very good work. Besides that, I have a responsive, fitting navigation system, a very consistent and well-designed mobile layout, as a well thought out color scheme.</p>
